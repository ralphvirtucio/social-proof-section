## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

What I learned with this challenge is the property transform, It's challenging to me because I'm not familiar with the property transform.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

.ratings ul li:nth-child(1) {
transform: translateX(0);
}
.ratings ul li:nth-child(3) {
transform: translateX(0);
}

.testimonials**second {
transform: translateY(0);
}
.testimonials**third {
transform: translateY(0);
}
